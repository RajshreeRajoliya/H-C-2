        <h1>Goodbye</h1>
        <p>You must think that I'm stupid
            You must think that I'm a fool
            You must think that I'm new to this
            But I have seen this all before
            I'm never gonna let you close to me
            Even though you mean the most to me
            'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
            So, I'm never gonna get too close to you
            Even when I mean the most to you
            In case you go and leave me in the dirt
            But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
            And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
            And every time you walk out, the less I love you
            Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
            I'm way too good at goodbyes
            (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
            I'm way too good at goodbyes
            (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
            I know you're thinking I'm heartless
            I know you're thinking I'm cold
            I'm just protecting my innocence
            I'm just protecting my soul
            I'm never gonna let you close to me
            Even though you mean the most to me
            'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
            So, I'm never gonna get too close to you
            Even when I mean the most to you
            In case you go and leave me in the dirt
            But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
            And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
            And every time you walk out, the less I love you
            Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
            I'm way too good at goodbyes
            (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
            I'm way too good at goodbyes
            (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
            No way that you'll see me cry
            (No way that you'll see me cry)
            I'm way too good at goodbyes
            (I'm way too good at goodbyes) no
            No, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
            No, no, no, no
            No, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
            (No way that you'll see me cry)
            Ah-ah-ah (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
            'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
            And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
            And every time you walk out, the less I love you
            Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
            I'm way too good at goodbyes</p>
